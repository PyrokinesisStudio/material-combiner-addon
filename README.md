material-combiner-addon
===========
#### An addon for Blender that allows to get lower draw calls in game engines by combining textures without quality loss and avoiding the problem of uv larger 0-1 bounds.

## FEATURES
* Combining multiple materials, allow selection, compatible with multiple objects.
* Generation of textures by UV size (allow to pack UV to 0-1 bounds), allow selection.
* Moving UV close as possible to bounds.
* Packing UV into the selected scale bounds by splitting mesh faces, compatible with rigged models.
